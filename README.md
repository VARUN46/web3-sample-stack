# Web3 Sample Stack
This is a sample application to understand Web3. In this app we will explore the Web3 tech stack - Ethereum Blockchain based Web3.js, Solidity Smart Contract and Vanilla JS.

## Codebase Deployment
The code can be deployed directly to Ethereum blockchain. 
We only need to deploy Solidity contract to Ethereum blockchain. 

The client app can be run on local machine. We only need to run the following command:
1. npm install
2. Start index.html on any server

In client application we need to configure the following things:-
1. Blockchain network url 
2. Contract ABI
3. Contract Address 

## Solidity Sample
This file is replica of template available with Remix IDE.
